* Name and partners name(At most teams of 2 folks total)
  * Team member 1: Dongwook Lee
* How many hours did it take you to complete this final project? 40 hours
* Did you collaborate or share ideas with any other students/TAs/Professors? Professor
* Did you use any external resources? 
  * Linear-Speed Vertex Cache Optimisation (Tom Forsyth) - http://eelpi.gotdns.org/papers/fast_vert_cache_opt.html
  * https://github.com/vivkin/forsyth
  * Optimizing the order of indices using the metadata of vertices was very interesting. Also, the fact that modern GPUs' optimization is already well-optimized was another interesting point. This was intriguing because I initially thought the algorithm could actually improve performance, but it did not.
